story delivery:
- nice, short intro; got to control character fairly quickly
- excellent flashback mechanism usage
- biggest complaint: end-game could've been better. I didn't know what to do sometimes.
	adthaan played at an early point, went to the mosque, couldn't pray
	short quests were cool, but sometimes it was counter intuitive:
		kill monsters for the lady so girl can recover, but save monster from monster hunters?
		decision tree: uhhhh, gg, goodbye monster hunters because that gives me more deed points
	I didn't really know what to do other than to solve each villager's problem
		got iron ore for the dude
		got monster drops for the doctor to heal the girl
		small moral decisions like gossiping/praying to dead people or something
		etc
	Point is, after I destroyed the monster hunters (which really didn't come off as bad guys) I was lost, and rested in the bed until I saw the end-game cutscene. I had to rest wayyyy too many times.
	(side note: honestly thought i was going to get bad deed points for killing them, and get good deed points for killing the monster)

battles:
- it was fun leveling up, collecting items but at some point it got a little tedious (I think after level 5 and a half)
- i was really motivated when I read it good deeds increases attack, but didn't see much of an increase
- the point above, but this time for the 'action/reaction' bar thing with the yellow target you're supposed to get
- why can't the action/reaction bar be pressed using 'Z' T_T QQ qq
- boss battle was fun, and was the motivating factor to reach a higher level (I beat the humans at level 8) and also motivated me to get all the equipment upgrades and also the full healing stuff the doctor gives you for monster drops.

not fun:
- random errors that shut the game down (occurred when I died 2-3 times, see error image)
- having to "rest" in the bed so time can go forward (my clock stopped moving after 5:19 AM lol)

overall decisions:
	go around village check things out, talk to everyone
	collect loot
	upgrade equipment
	farm until strong enough to beat the boss
	defeat the boss
	(hit a dead end here)
	rest until the you get the ending

overall feeling:
- brought back the fun rpg feel I remember as a kid
