# A Day and a Night v3

This is the third iteration/attempt to create the game "A Day and a Night." It centers around one man's search for redemption, as the last day of his life plays out. Will he reform himself as a new person, or turn back to his dark past?

You can play the first two (incomplete) versions: [v1](https://github.com/deengames/a-day-and-a-night) and [v2](https://github.com/deengames-prototypes/a-day-and-a-night-v2)

# Vision
- Teach people which deeds are (surprisingly) good and bad deeds
- Teach people deen, and sticking to that as much as possible
- Teach a practical implementation of muhasaba (self-accountability)
- Fun, exploratory gameplay style with lots and lots to do (and Amorphous+ style achievements)
- Short rounds, with lots of replayability -- ~48m for a single playthrough


# Prototype

**This is a prototype.** RPG Maker VX Ace is probably not the right tool to launch this in. We can change that later; make it ugly, make it fast, and make it fun. (Core gameplay should be achievable in a week.)
